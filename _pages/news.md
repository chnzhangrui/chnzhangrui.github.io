The white paper for machine learning-assisted calorimeter challenge has been accepted in Reports on Progress in Physics.
It summarises the state-of-the-art technologies used in fast calorimeter solution task in HEP.
Many of these technologies are now being developing in real experiments such as the ATLAS.
