I am actively involved in the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) located at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. My research focuses on experimental data processing and physical analysis, the application of machine learning and quantum machine learning, and the development of detector technologies. I am seeking to recruit 1-3 master's and doctoral students each year, and I also offer research internship opportunities for junior undergraduate students. I warmly welcome students with a strong interest in particle physics experiments to reach out! Additionally, I am continuously accepting applications for postdoctoral researchers. Feel free to reach out to me at rui.zhang@nju.edu.cn. I look forward to hearing from you!
